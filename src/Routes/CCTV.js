        ContentParagraph="Remotely monitored CCTV can deter intruders through the implementation of audio warnings and ensuring immediate action is always taken, whether by contacting key-holders or emergency services, to minimise both risk and damage to property and assets. When using unmonitored CCTV in your business, recorded footage can only be retrospectively reviewed: after the damage has already occurred and the intruder has likely already left the area."

We use state of the art technology to react to emergencies rapidly, acting as a deterrent that effectively stops intruders.

        AccordianTitle=" How does the system work in residential areas?"
        AccordianText="We try to keep disturbance to a minimum in all locations, however in residential areas we appreciate that this becomes even more important. Because our monitoring staff assess each individual alarm we only respond to genuine threats, minimising the disturbance caused to residents and pedestrians."
        AccordianTitle2="Is your team monitoring the cameras all the time?"
        AccordianText2="No, the surveillance equipment we install work using detection software that alerts staff based on detected movement. Although the cameras are recording 24/7 we only view the cameras once an alarm has been triggered or the camera detects movement. During working hours when the system is unarmed we will not view any images."
        AccordianTitle3="What are CCTV used for?"
        AccordianText3="CCTV systems are typically used to monitor and record the activity of a building, as well as its surroundings. These systems are used to primarily combat crime such as theft or vandalism. Also, these systems are also referred to as video surveillance."
